    - Studying the [samples and demos provided on OpenVINO](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_inference_engine_samples_speech_libs_and_demos_Offline_speech_recognition_demo.html)
    - Creating a planning document ([README.md](README.md))

    - Looking the [Speech Library](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_inference_engine_samples_speech_libs_and_demos_Speech_library.html) source code, and I liked the idea of the [Offline Speech Recognition Demo](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_inference_engine_samples_speech_libs_and_demos_Offline_speech_recognition_demo.html), thinking on use the *lspeech_s5_ext* model in the future, but while I'm familiar with c++, the time constraint of the project showcase will not let me dig deeper on it right now, so I've decided to find some python code around the subject
    - Found [a repository containing speech recognition with openvino + python](https://github.com/meshaun9/openvino_speech_recognition), trying to understand the code

    This is challenging for me, as I never had worked on this level of speech recognition (google cloud text-to-speech API hides all the machine learning steps from you :p)
